## 🧠 About Me

I'm a Smart Contracts & Fullstack dApp Developer passionate about building secure and efficient smart contracts for real-world blockchain applications. With a strong foundation in Ethereum development and decentralized systems, I enjoy turning complex ideas into clean, well-structured code.

I'm currently focused on expanding my impact in the Web3 space, contributing to projects where I can grow, collaborate, and help shape the decentralized future.

🔗 Backend API: https://escrow-backend-nbkb.onrender.com

## 🎯 Educational Value

Both projects reflect my ability to:
- Work end-to-end (frontend + backend).
- Apply **Solidity logic** to real-world problems.
- Use **digital signature verification (ECDSA)** and cryptographic hashing.
- Implement **persistent storage** (LowDB) for user wallets and balances.
- Follow **secure development principles**.

## 🚧 Future Improvements

- Fully migrate backend to a hosted database (e.g. MongoDB or Firebase)
- Add user authentication and encryption for localStorage
- Improve UI responsiveness and accessibility
